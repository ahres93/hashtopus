hashtopus
=========

2017: I guess this project is now abandoned.
I got out of the hash cracking scene. I think most of the code is still somehow valid and usable,
it just might not be compatible with new hashcat. There was a fork called Hashtopussy which was
done by a good team of people, so I encourage you to use it.

Distributed wrapper around oclHashcat
